## Final Update.
> Hello there. I am RL, or releaked. I made [this](https://github.com/LeakRE/TOHRE-LEAK) repository approximately 18d ago, I didn't know what doing that would eventually cause, but here we are. [Loonie has left TOHE altogether,](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1159375038219292753/1159375741578919946/image.png) [TOH:RE is officially dead.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1159375038219292753/1159375038823268362/image.png) What stands in it's place is something full of hope. **[Town Of Host: Enhanced](https://discord.gg/tohe)** I will not be leaking TOH: Enhanced because I truly believe that they can do what Karpe did, make a good mod. I witnessed the downfall of TOH:RE, the toppling of Loonie as ~~Tyrant~~ Developer, and the revolution of what now stands as TOH:E. I do not want to reveal who I am, this is obviously an alternate persona. No, I am not Pumpkin, I was the one who did forward him to [making a report to the TOH devs, however.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1159375038219292753/1159382733601120256/image.png) Thank you all though for supporting me, I do appreciate it. :] [I was so glad to see people happy to see me.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1159375038219292753/1159386327805083648/image.png) [Especially when I joined the TOH:E server.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1159375038219292753/1159386068110540840/image.png) *[third screenshot :)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1159375038219292753/1159386542154993737/image.png)* <br>

>  **I have a few things I must say though.**
> - To the Testers, and Sponsors of TOHRE, I have seen your complaining and I am sorry for the frustration I has caused.
> - To Moe, and the rest of the TOHE staff, I am sorry for any frustration I have caused while you all were looking for the leaker. Just glad you have now improved security and plan to make your mod more transparent :] *Also please let me in your server on my RL account.*
> - To Loonie, Grow up. Nice mod.. Oh wait. [**And stop grooming.**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-VH1VME4ePqXaDSZ-p1n6n7IaT-QPJHRKMVCIjmNJ6A)
> - To the people who supported me, thank you <3
> - To everyone..... Have a good day/night 🌞 :] <br>

> ### Regarding this repository. 
>
> I was a former associate of the TOHRE Discord Server. Throughout my time there, I witnessed Loonie (Main Dev) treating his [staff](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1158501440839483452/1158501441393148045/image.png) [(two)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1158501440839483452/1158501812383518761/image.png), and contributors badly. They take credit for their contributors' and Karpe's work, and I think that's just shitty. Not only that, but Talking bad about other mods too, just because they don't like the people making those mods. They also refuse to take accountability for bugs, saying "That's not a bug" when it so clearly is. Lastly. Loonie doesn't pay his contributors (More like the true mod dev's) for their work. It's kind of suspici that when [Loonie posted a screenshot of him "giving credit" it's in the one channel most people can't see.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1094353958455222375/1158381530985533601/image.png) More on the fact that his contributors do most of the coding for him, look at the screenshot he provided. Only 2 of the new features are his, and they're the easiest things to do in that build.
>
> Note: So, I've decided to publicise all of the TOH-RE Dev and Canary Builds. and, I will continue to do so as long as I have access to said ways. (What's next? Is our donations going to go to a new car?)
>
> ### Major Update!! (Update 5)
> The TOHRE Server is now closed, Moe (The Website Developer for tohre.dev) has made his own fork of TOHE called [Town Of Host: Enhanced](https://discord.gg/tohe). I suggest you join that if you wish to see the future of the mod. I will not be leaking TOHEN because Loonie is no longer apart of that team. Loonie's past has also been revealed, you can read that [here,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-VH1VME4ePqXaDSZ-p1n6n7IaT-QPJHRKMVCIjmNJ6A) It goes more into Loonie before TOH:RE and the Mod Chat. I will still be leaking TOH:RE versions if they come out, until they don't. Good Day. :]
>
> **Update**: So, it seems so that I now have a target on my back... okay. It's honestly surprising how many people don't realize that Loonie isn't some great deity. I mean... He said he "needed" the phone for 2FA... he honestly didn't, there's desktop applications of mobile 2FA apps that frankly work the same OR better then the original mobile app. (Cough, like [Authy!](https://authy.com/)) Also, reporting this repository will do nothing since I haven't broken any of Github's [Terms of Service.](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) Dinner is done so it's best I head out for now, links will be up soon!
>
> **Update 2**: Loonie is now breaking his GPL license by attempting to block your source from being built on. He really got scared by a few words, not shocking. Looks like I can turn back around and report your GH to the TOH devs. By the way Loonie, since you're so scared. While you're privating channels and breaking licenses, you mind updating the Discord Invite? Looks like you're still claiming your server is TOHE, and not TOH:RE. Thanks -U-.
>
> **Update 3**: Quick update before I head to bed, Any of the hyperlinks in the first paragraph are images proving what that accusation is. Have a good day/night folks! I'll be back later and/or tomorrow.
>
> **Update 4**: <3, Canary link is out!
>
> <br> [Latest Canary](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1158881588575219742/1158881625845805240/TOHE.dll)  [Latest Dev] **Latest Canary is out :], Although v3.1.0 is released now.**
>
> **If you wish to contact me, or have further inquiries. My Discord is "thereleak".**
